### The open-source Canva alternative for AI design.

**bring your own models &middot; own your files &middot; canvas AI &middot; self-hostable &middot; local-first**

The open design workspace for the AI era.

Canva made design easy. Kavero makes it yours.

</div>

Kavero is an open-source design workspace for people who want AI-powered creative tools without being locked inside one closed platform. It gives you a familiar visual canvas, generated asset history, AI-assisted editing workflows, provider-key control, and a local-first path you can run on your own machine.

## Why Kavero

Creative tools are turning into closed bundles: their models, their storage, their workflow, their pricing. Kavero is built around a different idea.

You should be able to bring your own models, keep control of your files, run the core product yourself, and still get a polished design workspace that feels approachable from the first click.

Kavero is for creators, founders, marketers, small agencies, and builders who need to make social posts, launch graphics, ads, thumbnails, pitch visuals, and client assets without handing the whole workflow to a closed suite.

## Highlights

- **Familiar canvas**: create designs with text, shapes, images, pages, assets, and PNG export.
- **AI generation**: generate visuals with prompt presets, references, model settings, and saved history.
- **Canvas AI**: use AI workflows for layout help, segmentation, asset generation, and image judging.
- **Gallery**: keep generated images organized and bring them back into your work.
- **BYOK provider keys**: keep AI access tied to your own provider accounts.
- **Own your storage**: use local managed storage or connect external storage flows.
- **Local-first setup**: run Kavero with the bundled Docker Compose Supabase stack.
- **Self-hostable foundation**: configure Kavero against your own Supabase-backed deployment.

## Get Started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22+ or 24+
- pnpm
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm setup
pnpm setup:run
```

Open Kavero:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

The setup wizard creates local env files safely, protects existing secrets, and can start the local Docker stack for you.

## Choose Your Setup

### Local Docker

Recommended for trying Kavero with the full local stack.

```bash
pnpm setup
pnpm setup:run
```

Local Docker runs:

- Kavero app
- Supabase Auth
- Postgres
- PostgREST
- Supabase Storage
- Supabase bootstrap checks
- Local managed file storage through a Docker volume

Local Docker uses email/password sign-in and this storage contract:

```env
KAVERO_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=local-first
KAVERO_AUTH_MODE=password
KAVERO_STORAGE_PROVIDER=kavero-managed
KAVERO_MANAGED_STORAGE_BACKEND=local-filesystem
KAVERO_LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT=/data/kavero-storage
```

`/data/kavero-storage` is a container path backed by the `kavero-local-storage` Docker volume.

Manual Docker command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker.local up --build
```

### Cloud / Self-Host

Use this path when you already have a Supabase project or a hosted Supabase-compatible stack.

```bash
pnpm setup
pnpm kavero doctor cloud-self-host
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Minimum env shape:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
KAVERO_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=cloud
KAVERO_AUTH_MODE=google
```

Optional provider-owned storage:

```env
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Optional Kavero-managed storage:

```env
KAVERO_STORAGE_PROVIDER=kavero-managed
KAVERO_MANAGED_STORAGE_BACKEND=supabase-storage
```

## First Run

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
2. Create an account.
3. Go to Settings -> API keys.
4. Add your AI provider key.
5. Open `/generate` or `/canvas`.

From there, generate assets, keep them in Gallery, place them into the canvas, edit the design, and export when ready.

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.env.docker.local` | Local Docker stack. Created by `pnpm setup`. |
| `.env.local` | Local development or Cloud/self-host env. |
| `.env.example` | Manual Cloud/self-host reference. |
| `.env.docker.local.example` | Manual Local Docker reference. |

Important envs:

| Env | Used for |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Browser-facing Supabase URL. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Browser/server Supabase client key. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Admin-backed app flows and provider-key storage. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public Kavero app origin. |
| `KAVERO_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE` | `cloud` or `local-first`. |
| `KAVERO_AUTH_MODE` | `google`, `password`, or `google-password`. |
| `KAVERO_STORAGE_PROVIDER` | Selects new-write storage behavior. |
| `KAVERO_MANAGED_STORAGE_BACKEND` | `supabase-storage` or `local-filesystem`. |
| `KAVERO_LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT` | Absolute storage root, or `/data/kavero-storage` in Docker. |

The setup CLI keeps existing non-empty values by default, asks before replacing secrets, writes through a backup, and never echoes secrets back to your terminal.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm setup` | Guided setup wizard. |
| `pnpm setup:doctor` | Check Local Docker configuration. |
| `pnpm kavero doctor cloud-self-host` | Check Cloud/self-host configuration. |
| `pnpm setup:run` | Run Local Docker with `docker compose up --build`. |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Next.js development server. |
| `pnpm build` | Build for production. |
| `pnpm start` | Start the production server. |
| `pnpm test` | Run Vitest. |
| `pnpm test:smoke` | Run Playwright smoke tests. |

src/modules/generation     Standalone /generate runtime
src/modules/gallery        Generated image history and Gallery runtime
src/modules/storage        Managed and connected storage foundation
src/modules/assets         Canvas asset helpers
src/modules/editor-panels  Canvas panel UI
src/lib                    Shared auth, Supabase, Drive, provider-key, and utility code
supabase                   Schema and local foundation SQL

```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/setup
pnpm exec vitest run src/modules/generation
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm build
```

Local Supabase helper scripts are available when you want to work outside the Docker Compose app flow:
